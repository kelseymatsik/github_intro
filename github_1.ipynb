    "- **Git** is version control software. It allows you to get content from GitHub (forking and `! git clone ...`), track all your desired changes (`commit`), split the project and work on different versions (`branch`), and return them to your GitHub account (`! git push ...`)\n",
    "- The fundamental idea is: Git turns a directory into a self-contained archive of past changes, called a **repository** or repo. When you make changes that you want to save, you tell Git to create a new snapshot of the repo, called a **commit**.\n",
    "- GitHub is a commercial product for hosting repos built on the free Git software; GitHub is not Git\n",

    "- Colab's compute resources are sufficient for most things, but not everything: You can run out of storage space, or have jobs that take too long with the available cores/memory. On Rivanna, you can ask for a much more powerful computing environment, and you have up to a terabyte of storage space in the scratch drive.\n",
    "- Small jobs and early homework assignments can be done on Colab easily. Projects and more complex assignments are probably easier to do on Rivanna.\n",

    "`! git clone https://github.com/<Username>/<Repo>`\n",
